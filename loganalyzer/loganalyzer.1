.SH NAME
loganalyzer \- analyze log files using mmap() and report statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B loganalyzer
\fB-f\fR \fILOGFILE\fR [\fB-k\fR \fIKEYWORD\fR] [\fB-l\fR] [\fB-h\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B loganalyzer
command analyzes a text log file and reports basic statistics. It uses
the
.BR mmap (2)
system call to map the file into memory for efficient processing.

By default it prints the total number of bytes and lines in the log file.
If a keyword is specified, it also counts how many lines contain that keyword.
When the \fB-l\fR option is used, it reports how many lines contain the
strings "INFO", "WARN", and "ERROR".

The program installs a handler for
.BR SIGINT
(Ctrl+C) and will stop analysis gracefully if interrupted by the user.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-f\fR \fILOGFILE\fR
Path to the log file to analyze. This option is required.
.TP
\fB-k\fR \fIKEYWORD\fR

.TP
\fB-l\fR
Count log levels by reporting how many lines contain "INFO", "WARN",
and "ERROR".

Display a brief help message and exit.
